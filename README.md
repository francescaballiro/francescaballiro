### 🚀 About me

- 🔭 I recently worked on **NutriCHOice**, an AI assistant designed to support **people with diabetes** in managing their daily carbohydrate intake (CHO) through personalized meal suggestions based on dietary preferences.  
- 🎓 I’m completing a degree in **Industrial Engineering – Management Track** while expanding my skills in AI technologies, prompt engineering, and LLM-based applications.  
- 💼 I’m actively looking for work opportunities in **applied AI**, with interest in projects that merge innovation and organizational problem-solving.  
- 🌿 I also bring a unique background in business operations: for over 4 years, I managed an agricultural company, overseeing administration, digital communication, and supplier relations. This experience taught me adaptability, responsibility, and the value of clear communication.  
- 💬 Ask me about: bootcamp projects, conversational AI workflows, hybrid retrieval systems, and managing tech projects from start to finish.
